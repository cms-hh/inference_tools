Script to rename one or multiple processes in a datacard.
Example usage:

# rename via simple rules
> rename_processes.py datacard.txt ggH_process=ggHH_kl_1_kt_1 -d output_directory

# rename multiple processes using a replacement rule
# (note the quotes)
> rename_processes.py datacard.txt '^ggH_process_(.+)$=ggHH_kl_1_kt_1_\1' -d output_directory

# rename via rules in files
> rename_processes.py datacard.txt my_rules.txt -d output_directory

Note: The use of an output directory is recommended to keep input files
      unchanged.
